# Change Log

## 0.29.0 **UNRELEASED**

- Added `configureBasedOnAppliedPlugins(sourcesJar: Boolean, javadocJar: Boolean)`
  overload that allows disabling sources and javadoc jars without having to use
  the more granular `Platform` APIs.
- For Java library and Kotlin/JVM projects the Gradle module metadata now properly
  includes the sources jar.
- When running on Gradle 8.8 or newer the pom configuration is not applied in
  `afterEvaluate` anymore, making manual overrides easier.
- Fix potential issue with the javadoc jar tasks that can cause Gradle to disable
  optimizations.
- When staging profiles can't be loaded the status code of the response is added
  to the error message.

#### Minimum supported versions
- JDK 11
- Gradle 8.1
- Android Gradle Plugin 8.0.0
- Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.9.20

- Dokka does not support configuration cache


## 0.28.0 *(2024-03-12)*

- Added support for publishing through the new [Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com). To use
  this use the `CENTRAL_PORTAL` option when specifying the Sonatype host.
- For Kotlin Multiplatform the main plugin will now automatically publish the
  `release` variant if the project has an Android target and no variant was explicitly
  specified through the Kotlin Gradle DSL.
- Support specifying the Android variants to publish in `KotlinMultiplatform(...)`.
- Updated minimum supported Gradle, Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin versions.
- Removed support for the deprecated Kotlin/JS plugin.
- Removed the deprecated `closeAndReleaseRepository` task. Use `releaseRepository`, which
  is functionally equivalent, instead.

## 0.27.0 *(2024-01-06)*

- Added new publishing related tasks
    - `releaseRepository` releases a staging repository at the end of the build
      and can be executed in the same build as the publishing task. This allows
      having automatic releases without permanently enabling them.
    - `publishToMavenCentral` as alias for running `publishAllPublicationsToMavenCentralRepository`.
    - `publishAndReleaseToMavenCentral` as alias for running both of the above.
    - For more information [checkout the docs](https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/central/#publishing-releases).
- It is now possible to only pass a subset of the parameters to
  `coordinates(...)` and leave the others at their default value.
  Thanks to @sschuberth for the contribution.
- Fixed `java-test-fixture` projects being broken with Gradle 8.6.
- Deprecated `closeAndReleaseRepository` in favor of `releaseRepository`.

- Dokka does not support configuration cache


## 0.26.0 *(2023-12-19)*

- It's now supported to call `configure(Platform)` from the main plugin to modify
  what is getting published. [Check out the docs for more details](https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/what/)
- The base plugin now has a `configureBasedOnAppliedPlugins` DSL method to
  allow applying the default `configure` logic of the main plugin.
- Calling `configure(Platform)` now validates that the required plugins are
  applied (e.g. Android Gradle Plugin for Android projects).
- It's now possible to disable source publishing for KMP projects.
- Fixed an issue which would cause the javadoc jar task to be registered multiple
  times for Gradle plugin projects with more than one publication. Thanks to
  @autonomousapps for the fix.
- Publishing Kotlin/JS projects has been deprecated and will be removed in the
  next release, because the Kotlin/JS plugin has been deprecated.
- The internal task to create a javadoc jar for certain project types has been renamed
  from `simpleJavadocJar` to `plainJavadocJar`. Thanks to @sschuberth.

#### Minimum supported versions
- JDK 11

#### Configuration cache status

When using **Gradle 8.1** or newer configuration cache is generally supported.

Exceptions to that are:
- Publishing releases to Maven Central (snapshots are fine), blocked by [Gradle issue #22779](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/22779).
- Dokka does not support configuration cache


## 0.25.3 *(2023-07-01)*

- Gradle 8.2: Fix error for projects that use the `java-test-fixtures` plugin.
- Fix issue for Kotlin Multiplatform projects when running tests and having signing enabled.


## 0.25.2 *(2023-04-16)*

- Fix javadoc jar being empty when using dokka.


## 0.25.1 *(2023-03-24)*

- Fix snapshot publishing being broken.


## 0.25.0 *(2023-03-23)*

- The `createStagingRepository` task now uses the worker API which allows the project to built
  in parallel to the creation of the staging repository.
- Fix incompatibility with Kotlin 1.8.20-Beta for Kotlin/JS projects. The Kotlin/JS plugin is now taking
  care of creating the sources jar on its own. Because of this the base plugin won't allow disabling
  sources jar creation for Kotlin/JS projects anymore starting with 1.8.20. The `KotlinJs` constructor
  with a `sourcesJar` parameter has been deprecated.
- Fix incompatibility with Gradle 8.1 for `java-test-fixtures` projects
- Fix incompatibility with `com.gradle.plugin-publish` 1.0.0 and 1.1.0
- New minimum supported versions:
  - Gradle 7.4
  - Android Gradle Plugin 7.3.0
  - Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.7.0
  - `com.gradle.plugin-publish` 1.0.0
- Note: Starting with Kotlin 1.8.20-Beta the `common` sources jar for multiplatform projects will only contain
  the sources of the common source set instead of containing the sources from all source sets.

#### Configuration cache status

Configuration cache is supported starting with **Gradle 7.6+** except for:
- Builds with enabled signing, will be resolved in Gradle 8.1.
- Publishing releases to Maven Central (snapshots are fine), blocked by [Gradle issue #22779](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/22779).
- Kotlin Multiplatform projects, blocked by [KT-49933](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-49933).


## 0.24.0 *(2023-01-29)*

- Support arbitrary Sonatype hosts instead of just oss.sonatype.org and s01.oss.sonatype.org.
- Support adjusting timeouts for Sonatype related requests and operations. [See docs](https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/central/#timeouts)
- Internal change on how the sources jar is created.


## 0.23.2 *(2023-01-17)*

- Fix signing when using Gradle 8.0.
- Finding a matching staging profile in Sonatype is more lenient. If there is just one that one will always be used.
  The plugin will also fallback to any staging profile that has a matching prefix with the group id.
- As a workaround for an issue in Gradle that causes invalid module metadata for `java-test-fixtures` projects, `project.group`
  and `project.version` are now being set again for those projects. [#490](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/pull/490)


## 0.23.1 *(2022-12-30)*

- Also support publishing sources for the `java-test-fixtures` plugin in Kotlin/JVM projects.
- Suppress Gradle warnings when publishing a project that uses `java-test-fixtures`.


## 0.23.0 *(2022-12-29)*

Updated docs can be found on [the new website](https://vanniktech.github.io/gradle-maven-publish-plugin/).

- **NEW**: It is now possible to set group id, artifact id directly through the DSL
  ```groovy
  mavenPublishing {
    coordinates("com.example", "library", "1.0.3")
  }
  ```
- `project.group` and `project.version` will still be used as default values for group and version if the
  `GROUP`/`VERSION_NAME` Gradle properties do not exist and `coordinates` was not called, however there are 2
  **behavior changes**:
    - The `GROUP` and `VERSION_NAME` Gradle properties take precedence over `project.group` and `project.version` instead
      of being overwritten by them. If you need to define the properties but replace them for some projects,
      please use the new `coordinates` method instead.
    - The `GROUP` and `VERSION_NAME` Gradle properties will not be explicitly set as `project.group` and
      `project.version` anymore.
- **NEW**: Added `dropRepository` task that will drop a Sonatype staging repository. It is possible to specify
  which repository to drop by adding a `--repository` parameter with the id of the staging repository that was
  printed during `publish`. If no repository is specified and there is only one staging repository, that one
  will be dropped.
- Added workaround to also publish sources for the `java-test-fixtures` plugin
- Fixed publishing Kotlin/JS projects with the base plugin.
- Fixed that a POM configured through the DSL is incomplete when publishing Gradle plugins.
- The minimum supported Gradle version has been increased to 7.3.
- The plugin now requires using JDK 11+ to run Gradle.


## 0.22.0 *(2022-09-09)*

- **NEW**: When publishing to maven central by setting `SONATYPE_HOST` or calling `publishToMavenCentral(...)` the plugin will now explicitly create a staging repository on Sonatype. This avoids issues where a single build would create multiple repositories
- The above change means that the plugin supports parallel builds and it is not neccessary anymore to use `--no-parallel` and `--no-daemon` together with `publish`
- **NEW**: When publishing with the `publish` or `publishAllPublicationsToMavenCentralRepository` tasks the plugin will automatically close the staging repository at the end of the build if it was successful.
- **NEW**: Option to also automatically release the staging repository after closing was susccessful
```
SONATYPE_HOST=DEFAULT # or S01
SONATYPE_AUTOMATIC_RELEASE=true
```
or
```
mavenPublishing {
  publishToMavenCentral("DEFAULT", true)
  // or publishToMavenCentral("S01", true)
}
```
- in case the option above is enabled, the `closeAndReleaseRepository` task is not needed anymore
- when closing the repository fails the plugin will fail the build immediately instead of timing out
- when closing the repository fails the plugin will try to print the error messages from Nexus
- increased timeouts for calls to the Sonatype Nexus APIs
- fixed incompatibility with the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin
- added wokaround for Kotlin multiplatform builds reporting disabled build optimizations (see [KT-46466](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-46466))


## 0.21.0 *(2022-07-11)*

Minimum supported Gradle version is now 7.2.0

Minimum supported Android Gradle Plugin versions are now 7.1.2, 7.2.0-beta02 and 7.3.0-alpha01

**Behavior changes**

The `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` stops adding Maven Central (Sonatype OSS) as a
publishing target and will not enable GPG signing by default. To continue publishing to maven central and signing artifacts either add the following to your `gradle.properties`:
```properties
SONATYPE_HOST=DEFAULT
# SONATYPE_HOST=S01 for publishing through s01.oss.sonatype.org
RELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED=true
```

or add this to your Groovy build files:
```gradle
mavenPublishing {
  publishToMavenCentral()
  // publishToMavenCentral("S01") for publishing through s01.oss.sonatype.org
  signAllPublications()
}
```
or the following to your kts build files:
```kotlin
mavenPublishing {
  publishToMavenCentral()
  // publishToMavenCentral(SonatypeHost.S01) for publishing through s01.oss.sonatype.org
  signAllPublications()
}
```

The base plugin is unaffected by these changes because it already has this behavior.

**Android variant publishing**

Since version 0.19.0 the plugin was publishing a multi variant library by
default for Android projects. Due to [a bug in Android Studio](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/197636221)
that will cause it to not find the sources for libraries published this way the
plugin will temporarily revert to publishing single variant libraries again.
Unless another variant is specified by setting the `ANDROID_VARIANT_TO_PUBLISH`
Gradle property the `release` variant will be published.

To continue publishing multi variant libraries you can use the
[base plugin](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin#base-plugin).

**Removals**

The deprecated `mavenPublish` extension has been removed. Take a look at the
changelog for 0.20.0 for replacements.


## 0.20.0 *(2022-06-02)*

**Upcoming behavior change**

In the next release after this the `com.vanniktech.maven.publish` will stop adding Maven Central (Sonatype OSS) as a
publishing target and will not enable GPG signing by default. If you are currently relying on this behavior the plugin
will print a warning during configuration phase. To continue publishing to maven central and signing artifacts either
add this to your build files:
```gradle
mavenPublishing {
  publishToMavenCentral() // use publishToMavenCentral("S01") for publishing through s01.oss.sonatype.org
  signAllPublications()
}
```
or the following to your `gradle.properties`:
```gradle
SONATYPE_HOST=DEFAULT
# SONATYPE_HOST=S01 for publishing through s01.oss.sonatype.org
RELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED=true
```

The base plugin is unaffected by these changes because it already has this behavior.

**Deprecation**

The old `mavenPublish` extension has been deprecated.

If you were using it to set `sonatypeHost` to `S01` use
```gradle
mavenPublishing {
  publishToMavenCentral("S01")
}
```
instead or add `SONATYPE_HOST=S01` to your gradle.properties.

If `sonatypeHost` was used to disable adding Maven Central as a publishing target add `SONATYPE_HOST=` until 0.21.0 is out and this becomes the default behavior.

If you set `releaseSigningEnabled` to false add `RELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED=false` to your gradle.properties until 0.21.0 is out and this becomes the default behavior.


**New**

Added support to set the following pom values through properties (thanks to @jaredsburrows for the contribution)
- `POM_ISSUE_SYSTEM` sets `issueManagement.system`
- `POM_ISSUE_URL` sets `issueManagement.url`
- `POM_DEVELOPER_EMAIL` sets `developer.email`

**Fixed**

- resolved an issue in Kotlin Multiplatform projects that apply `com.android.library` that caused no sources jars to be published
- resolved an issue in Kotlin Multiplatform projects that apply `com.android.library` using AGP versions before 7.1.2 that caused the project to be published as a pure Android library
- fixed and improved error messages for `closeAndReleaseRepository`


## 0.19.0 *(2022-02-26)*

- **Behavior Change:** When using version 7.1.0 or newer of the Android Gradle Plugin we will now publish all variants
of a library unless `androidVariantToPublish` was set in the DSL. This means that for example both `debug` and `release`
or all flavors.
- Deprecated `androidVariantToPublish`. In the future the main plugin will always publish all variants of an Android
library. If you need to publish only one variant or a subset take a look at the [base plugin](README.md#base-plugin)
APIs.
- Base plugin: Added `AndroidSingleVariantLibrary` and `AndroidMultiVariantLibrary` options that use the new AGP 7.1
APIs under the hood.
- Base plugin: Deprecated `AndroidLibrary` option in favor of the above
- The integration with Sonatype Nexus has been extracted into it's own artifact and is available as `com.vanniktech:nexus:<version>`


## 0.18.0 *(2021-09-13)*

- The minimum supported Kotlin version is now `1.4.30`
- It's now possible to specify `SONATYPE_HOST` as a Gradle property, e.g.
  - `SONATYPE_HOST=S01` for `s01.sonatype.org`
  - `SONATYPE_HOST=` to not add any repository by default
- Fixed an issue when publishing Kotlin MPP projects with the base plugin
- Removed checks for presence of properties that aren't used by this plugin anymore


## 0.17.0 *(2021-07-04)*

- Removed the deprecated `uploadArchives` and `installArchives` tasks. Use `publish` and `publishToMavenLocal` instead.


## 0.16.0 *(2021-06-20)*

- Add `pomFromGradleProperties` API to base plugin. This configures the pom in the same way the regular plugin does.
- Add the ability to remove the default `mavenCentral` repository, by setting `sonatypeHost` to `null`
- Support `POM_LICENSE_NAME`, `POM_LICENSE_URL` and `POM_LICENSE_DIST` properties in addition to `LICENCE` based properties.
- Fixes an issue in the base plugin that caused an error during configuration of Android projects.
- Fixes an issue with javadoc tasks when using Java toolchains.
- The deprecated `nexusOptions` and `nexus {}` methods were removed. `closeAndReleaseRepository` is automatically configured.


## 0.15.1 *(2021-05-02)*

- The `closeAndReleaseRepository` task was mistakenly expecting the wrong Gradle properties. The README and changelog also mentioned the wrong properties. The correct ones are `mavenCentralUsername` and `mavenCentralPassword` or for environment variables: `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralUsername` and `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralPassword`.
- Fix `signing` not being configurable until `afterEvaluate`
- Use empty string as in memory signing password when no password is specified
- Fix `statingProfile` in `nexusOptions` not being optional which causes an error when running `closeAndReleaseRepository`


## 0.15.0 *(2021-04-24)*

- **BREAKING**: Removed support for deprecated `RELEASE_REPOSITORY_URL`, `SNAPSHOT_REPOSITORY_URL`, `SONATYPE_NEXUS_USERNAME`, `SONATYPE_NEXUS_PASSWORD` environment variables and properties.
  For safety reasons the project will fail when finding these. Use `mavenCentralUsername` and `mavenCentralPassword` Gradle properties or
  `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralUsername` and `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_mavenCentralPassword` environment variables instead.
- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated `targets` API. See README for alternative ways of adding targets.
- Behavior change: The dokka plugin is not applied by default anymore for Kotlin projects. When it is applied we will still use the dokka tasks to create the javadoc jar.
- Support for `s01.oss.sonatype.org` by setting `sonatypeHost = "S01"`.
- Introduce `com.vanniktech.maven.publish.base` plugin. This plugin contains all the functionality of the main plugin, but does not configure anything automatically.
  Instead, it offers a public API, which is also used by the main plugin to do so yourself. This allows for more flexibility and to publish different project types.
  The API is not final yet, but we're happy to receive feedback.


## 0.14.2 *(2021-02-14)*

- fix artifact id in Kotlin Multiplatform projects being incorrect
- fix `closeAndReleaseRepository` requiring callers to pass `--repository`
