# Base plugin

The base plugin generally provides the same functionality as the main plugin,
but it doesn't configure anything automatically and instead relies on manual
configuration.

## Applying the plugin

Add the plugin to any Gradle project that should be published

=== "build.gradle"

    ```groovy
    plugins {
      id "com.vanniktech.maven.publish.base" version "<latest-version>"
    }
    ```

=== "build.gradle.kts"

    ```kotlin
    plugins {
      id("com.vanniktech.maven.publish.base") version "<latest-version>"
    }
    ```

## General configuration

Follow the steps of the [Maven Central](central.md) or [other Maven repositories](other.md) guides.
Note that the `SONATYPE_HOST`, `SONATYPE_AUTOMATIC_RELEASE` and `RELEASE_SIGNING_ENABLED` are not
considered by the base plugin and the appropriate DSL methods need to be called.

For the pom configuration via Gradle properties the following needs to be enabled in the DSL:

=== "build.gradle"

    ```groovy
    mavenPublishing {
      pomFromGradleProperties()
    }
    ```

=== "build.gradle.kts"

    ```kotlin
    mavenPublishing {
      pomFromGradleProperties()
    }
    ```

## Configuring what to publish

To define what should be published, the `configure` method in the `mavenPublishing`
block needs to be called. Check out the [what to publish page](what.md) which
contains a detailed description of available options for each project type.

It is also possible to get the automatic behavior of the main plugin by calling
`configureBasedOnAppliedPlugins()` instead of `configure`

=== "build.gradle"

    ```groovy
    mavenPublishing {
      configure(...)
      // or
      configureBasedOnAppliedPlugins()
    }
    ```

=== "build.gradle.kts"

    ```kotlin
    mavenPublishing {
      configure(...)
      // or
      configureBasedOnAppliedPlugins()
    }
    ```
