# gradle-maven-publish-plugin

Gradle plugin that creates a `publish` task to automatically upload all of your Java, Kotlin or Android
libraries to any Maven instance. This plugin is based on [Chris Banes initial implementation](https://github.com/chrisbanes/gradle-mvn-push)
and has been enhanced to add Kotlin support and keep up with the latest changes.
